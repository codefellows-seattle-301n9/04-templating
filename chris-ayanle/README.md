## Overview
We're building a small blog using Handlebars and jQuery
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
clone this repo
Review the scripts and styles directory.
Review index.html
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
We've used Handlebars and jQuery to building a very simple single-page application
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
