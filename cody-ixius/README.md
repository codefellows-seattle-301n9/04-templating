## Overview
This application is designed to render articles with consistent formatting so that the user can visit the site often and have the same experience each time, and so that the owner can render articles using a template so that they can easily edit the way articles are rendered.

## Getting Started
The user can clone down the github repo and open it in a web browser.
## Architecture
We used HTML, and CSS for the structure and styling of our application, and javascript for function. We also used jQuery, and handlebars for templating. With the user experience in mind, the application layout was thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and able to be executed efficiently.
