# Lab 04 - JQuery and Events

**Author**: Driver: Eric - Navigator: Dennis
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
The purpose of this application is to build on the previous lab that creates arrays of new articles. Now that we have the new articles running, our goal is to create the functionality of being able to filter articles so that the user can selectively view articles by author or by category.


## Getting Started
1. The User must clone the starter code.
2. The User must link the .js scripts to the end of HTML
3. Create event handler type functions for filters
4. Call the functions for the handler filters 

## Architecture
1. We completed TODO's in article.js and others.
2. We completed Comment's on several pages.
