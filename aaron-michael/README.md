## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
<!--We are using this application for lab learning purposes, specifically to use handlebars in palcement of function expressions as well as refacotring functions into arrow functions.-->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
<!--First we read through all the TODOs, COMMENTS, and REVIEWs. Then we started with the html page and built our template, then accessed it in the article.js file, and then refactored the function expressions in articleView.js to arrow functions.-->
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
