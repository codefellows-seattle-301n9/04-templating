**Today, Eric and Dennis paired together. It took about 5 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started with the HTML and replaced all of the script tags to allow our articles to render, using the Handlebars template
  2. Next, we refactored our filter methods into arrow functions
  3. We added Handlebars source 4.0.1 - CDN and minimized Jquery 3.1.1 to the end of the HTML code
