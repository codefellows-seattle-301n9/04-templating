## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This appliction was refactored using Handlebars to create a template and populate each article to that template structure. This assignment also used ES6 arrow functions to refactor when applicable.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Fork the master repo, clone to your local machine, add normalize.css file and connect the Handlebars.js CDN, launch in the browser.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
CDN for Handlebars.js, CDN for jQuery, and normalize.css to start with a consistant browser rendering.
